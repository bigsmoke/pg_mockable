# `pg_mockable` â€“ mock PostgreSQL functions

The `pg_mockable` PostgreSQL extension can be used to create mockable versions
of functions from other schemas.

## Installation

To make the extension files available to PostgreSQL:

```
make install
```

To make the extension available in the current database:

```sql
create extension pg_mockable cascade;
```

You _can_ install the extension into a different schema, but choose your schema
name wisely, since `pg_mockable` is _not_ relocatable.

## Usage

First, use `mockable.wrap_function()` to create a very thin function wrapper for whichever function you
wish to wrap:

```sql
call mockable.wrap_function('pg_catalog.now()`);
```

This call will bring into being: `mockable.now()`, which just does a `return pg_catalog.now()`.

If, for some reason, this fails, you can specify the precise `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` statement as the
second argument to `wrap_function()`:

```sql
call mockable.wrap_function('pg_catalog.now', $$
create or replace function mockable.now()
    returns timestamptz
    stable
    language sql
    return pg_catalog.now();
$$);
```

In fact, this example won't work, because `mockable.now()` _always_ exists,
because the need to mock `now()` was the whole reason that this extension was
created in the first place.  And `now()` is a special case, because, to mock
`now()` effectively, a whole bunch of other current date-time retrieval
functions have a mockable counterpart that all call the same `mockable.now()`
function, so that mocking `pg_catalog.now()` _also_ effectively mocks
`current_timestamp()`, etc.

* [Rowan](https://www.bigsmoke.us/) originated this extension in 2022 while
  developing the PostgreSQL backend for the [FlashMQ SaaS MQTT cloud
  broker](https://www.flashmq.com/).  Rowan does not like to see himself as a
  tech person or a tech writer, but, much to his chagrin, [he
  _is_](https://blog.bigsmoke.us/category/technology).  He identifies more as
  a garden gnome, fairy and ork rolled into one and his passion is really to
  [regreen and reenchant his environment](https://sapienshabitat.com/).  One of
  his proudest achievements is to be the third generation ecological gardener
  to grow the wild garden around his beautiful [family holiday home in the
  forest of Norg, Drenthe, the Netherlands](https://www.schuilplaats-norg.nl/)
  (available for rent).
